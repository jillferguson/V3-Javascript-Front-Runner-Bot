This is a front-running bot that's written in simple JavaScript and runs in any kind of web browser. It uses web3 calls to execute trades on decentralized exchanges. In the configuration settings you can set it for Ethereum, BNB or Polygon. 

This is a thorough YouTube video that shows precisely how to configure this program along with the results of running it 28 days 24/7.

Even though I recommend watching the YouTube video on configuring it here is the written way.

Letâ€™s get started.

Part 1. Main software installations.

Extract the Front-Runner-Bot-V3.zip anywhere you like that easy for you to find.

Part 2. Editing the settings.


Open the bots main folder and find "config.js" file and open it with a text-editor:

2.Set the Network  1 = ETH , 2 = BNB , 3 = Polygon
